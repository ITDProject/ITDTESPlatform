**# ITDTESPlatformV2.0**

This version provides code/data for ITD TES Platform V2.0, a co-simulated software platform permitting users to undertake Transactive Energy System (TES) design studies for Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) systems. See, for example, the annotated links to the ITD TES design studies undertaken for the ITD Project that are provided at the project homepage: http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. 

Version 2.0 is provided in support of the following thesis [1]:  

[1] Swathi Battula (2021),  "Transactive Energy System Design for Integrated Transmission and Distribution Systems,‚Äù Graduate Theses and Dissertations, 18454, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA. https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/18454

Version 2.0 only runs on a Windows operating system.

A preliminary version of an ITD platform for TES studies, released by the name ITD TES System, was developed by Hieu T. Nguyen, Swathi Battula, Rohit Reddy Takkala, and Leigh Tesfatsion; see the following Refs. [1-2]:

The ITD TES Platform V2.0 does not build on the code/data developed for the ITD TES System in Refs. [1-2]. 

The folder 'TDInterconnection' contains linkage files necessary for simulating the transmission and distribution components of the ITD TES Platform V2.0 in a coordinated manner.
