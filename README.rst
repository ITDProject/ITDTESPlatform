**# ITDTESPlatformV2.0**

This branch provides code/data for ITD TES Platform V2.0, a co-simulated software platform permitting users to undertake Transactive Energy System (TES) design studies for Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) systems. See, for example, the annotated links to the ITD TES design studies undertaken for the ITD Project that are provided at the project homepage: http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. 

Version 2.0 is provided in support of the following thesis [1]:  

[1] Swathi Battula (2021),  "Transactive Energy System Design for Integrated Transmission and Distribution Systems,‚Äù Graduate Theses and Dissertations, 18454, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA. https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/18454

The ITD TES Platform V2.0 only runs on a Windows operating system.

A preliminary version of an ITD platform for TES studies, released by the name ITD TES System, was developed by Hieu T. Nguyen et al. [1-2]:

The ITD TES Platform V2.0 does not build on the code/data developed for the ITD TES System in [1-2]. 

The folder 'TDInterconnection' contains linkage files necessary for simulating the transmission and distribution components of the ITD TES Platform V2.0 in a coordinated manner.

**Installation Instructions:**

1. Download the contents of this repository into a folder, let's call it 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0'. Now make 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0' the parent directory to install the components given in the steps 2 and 3.

2. Install the transmission component of the ITDTESPlatformV2.0, AMES V5.0, by following the installation instructions given at: https://github.com/ames-market/AMES-V5.0/blob/master/INSTALLATION.rst

3. Download the contents of the distribution component of ITDTESPlatformV2.0 located at https://github.com/ITDProject/HouseholdFormulationRepository into the directory 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0'. Follow the installation instructions given at https://github.com/ITDProject/HouseholdFormulationRepository#readme to install the necessary components.


**Steps involved in execution:**

#. Go to the parent directory of the distribution component and perform the execution steps listed below:

   #. Generate distribution grid populated with households with the choice of 'Household Type' by executing the following:

      python IEEE123_glm_yaml_bat_writer.py NDistSys Mix Type
   
      The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameters: 

      * NDistSys - The number of distribution systems that are handled by the IDSO

      * Mix - Represents if the chosen households are a mix of different structure types or single structure type;

        * Mix is set to 0: A single structure type, set by input parameter 'Type' described below, is chosen to populate the distribution grid;

        * Mix is set to 1: A mix of structure types Low, Medium, High are used to populate the distribution grid;

      * Type - Represents household's structure quality type; 

        * Set Type to 1 for Low Structure Quality Type;

        * Set Type to 2 for Medium Structure Quality Type;

        * Set Type to 3 for High Structure Quality Type;

      (Example usage: python IEEE123_glm_yaml_bat_writer.py 1 0 2)

   #. Generate required additional files by executing the following command:

      python prep_agents123.py FileName NDistSys 

      The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameters: 

      * FileName - The name of the distribution grid generated in the above step (do not include .glm extension)

      * NDistSys - The number of distribution systems that are handled by the IDSO

      (Example usage: python prep_agents123.py IEEEModified1 1)  

      Outcomes: FNCS configuration txt file and json registration files for IDSO and households.
      FNCS configuration txt file contains needed input information for configuring GridLAB-D subscriptions and publications. IDSO json file contains needed input information for the IDSO and Household json file contains household specific information (household attributes).

   #. Set the following parameters in the runITD.bat

      * TSDir - Set the path of parent directory of AMES
      * TDIDir - Set the path of TDIInterconnectionFiles folder to this parameter
      * DSDir - Set the path of HouseholdFormulationRepository folder to this parameter
      * AMESVersion - Set the version of AMES (e.g. AMESV5.0)

      * NDay - Number of days the simulation needs to be carried out

      * NHour - Number of additional hours the simulation needs to be carried out after the simulation is run for NDay

      * deltaT - Length (seconds) of each control-step of the Five-Step TES design

      * NoOfHouses - Number of households connected to the distribution grid

      * NDsystems - Number of distribution systems monitored by the IDSO

      * C - Choose an appropriate case; 

        * Set C to 0 for generating test case outcomes with a flat retail price. Also set FRP(cents/kWh) to user specified retail price 

        * Set C to 1 for generating test case outcomes for 'Test Case 2: IDSO Peak Load Reduction Capabilities'. Also set PL(kW) and TPLR(kW) to user specified values

        * Set C to 2 for generating test case outcomes for 'Test Case 3: IDSO Load Matching Capabilities'. Also set RefLoad


#. Run all the distribution system processes together with transmission processes by executing the following command:
   runITD.bat FileName
   The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameter:
   FileName - The name of the input data file, e.g. 2BusTestCase
