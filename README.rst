**# ITDTESPlatformV2.1**

This branch provides code/data for Version 2.1 of the ITD TES Platform, a co-simulated software platform permitting users to undertake Transactive Energy System (TES) design studies for Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) systems. See, for example, the annotated links to the ITD TES design studies undertaken for the ITD Project that are provided at the project homepage: http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. 

Version 2.1 only runs on a Windows operating system.

A preliminary version of an ITD platform for TES studies, released by the name ITD TES System, was developed by Hieu T. Nguyen et al. [1-2]:

The ITD TES Platform V2.1 does not build on the code/data developed for the ITD TES System in [1-2]. 

The ITD TES Platform V2.1 extends V2.0. It replicates the results of V2.0 (i.e., it generates the same output for the same input), but FNCS communications are implemented more efficiently.

The folder 'TDInterconnection' contains linkage files necessary for simulating the transmission and distribution components of the ITD TES Platform V2.1 in a coordinated manner.
