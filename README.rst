The code/data in this repository are for ITDTESPlatformV2.0 provided in support of the thesis Ref. [1]. 

[1] Swathi Battula (2021),  "Transactive Energy System Design for Integrated Transmission and Distribution Systems,‚Äù Graduate Theses and Dissertations, 18454, Iowa State University, Ames, IA. https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/18454

ITDTESPlatfromV2.0 is only supported on a Windows operating system.

Installation Instructions:

1. Download the contents of this repository into a folder, let's call it 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0'. Now make 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0' the parent directory to install the components given in the steps 2 and 3.

2. Install the transmission component of the ITDTESPlatformV2.0, AMES V5.0, by following the installation instructions given at: https://github.com/ames-market/AMES-V5.0/blob/master/INSTALLATION.rst

3. Download the contents of the distribution component of ITDTESPlatformV2.0 located at https://github.com/ITDProject/HouseholdFormulationRepository into the directory 'ITDTESPlatformV2.0'. Follow the installation instructions given at https://github.com/ITDProject/HouseholdFormulationRepository#readme to install the necessary components.


Steps involved in execution:

A. Go to the parent directory of the distribution component and perform the execution steps listed below:

   1. Generate distribution system feeder populated with households with the choice of 'Household Type' by executing the following:

     python IEEE123_glm_yaml_bat_writer.py NDistSys Mix Type

     The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameters: 

     NDistSys - The number of distribution systems that are handled by the IDSO

     Mix - Represents if the chosen households are a mix of different structure types or single structure type;

     Mix is set to 0: A single structure type, set by input parameter 'Type' described below, is chosen to populate the distribution system feeder;

     Mix is set to 1: A mix of structure types Low, Medium, High are used to populate the distribution system feeder;

     Type - Represents household's structure quality type; 

     Set Type to 1 for Low Structure Quality Type;

     Set Type to 2 for Medium Structure Quality Type;

     Set Type to 3 for High Structure Quality Type;

     (Example usage: python IEEE123_glm_yaml_bat_writer.py 1 0 2)

   2. Generate required additional files by executing the following command:

     python prep_agents123.py FileName NDistSys 

     The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameters: 

     FileName - The name of the distribution feeder generated in the above step (do not include .glm extension)

     NDistSys - The number of distribution systems that are handled by the IDSO

     (Example usage: python prep_agents123.py IEEEModified1 1)  

     Outcomes: FNCS configuration txt file and json registration files for IDSO and households.
     FNCS configuration txt file contains needed input information for configuring GridLAB-D subscriptions and publications. IDSO json file contains needed input information for the IDSO and Household json file contains household specific information (household attributes).

   3. Set the following parameters in the runITD.bat

     TSDir - Set the path of parent directory of AMES
     TDIDir - Set the path of TDIInterconnectionFiles folder to this parameter
     DSDir - Set the path of HouseholdFormulationRepository folder to this parameter
     AMESVersion - Set the version of AMES (e.g. AMESV5.0)

     NDay - Number of days the simulation needs to be carried out

     NHour - Number of additional hours the simulation needs to be carried out after the simulation is run for NDay

     deltaT - Length (seconds) of each control-step of the Five-Step TES design

     NoOfHouses - Number of households connected to the distribution system feeder

     NDsystems - Number of distribution systems monitored by the IDSO

     C - Choose an appropriate case; 

     Set C to 0 for generating test case outcomes with a flat retail price. Also set FRP(cents/kWh) to user specified retail price 

     Set C to 1 for generating test case outcomes for 'Test Case 2: IDSO Peak Load Reduction Capabilities'. Also set PL(kW) and TPLR(kW) to user specified values

     Set C to 2 for generating test case outcomes for 'Test Case 3: IDSO Load Matching Capabilities'. Also set RefLoad


B. Run all the distribution system processes together with transmission processes by executing the following command:
   runITD.bat FileName
   The above commands depend on the following user-specified parameter:
   FileName - The name of the input data file, e.g. 2BusTestCase
