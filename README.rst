**# ITDTESPlatform**

The ITDTESPlatform repository provides code/data for the ITD TES Platform V2.XX (and later), a co-simulated software platform developed by Swathi Battula and Leigh Tesfatsion at Iowa State University (2020-2021).  

The ITD TES Platform permits users to undertake Transactive Energy System (TES) design studies for Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) systems.  See, for example, the annotated links to the ITD TES design studies undertaken for the ITD Project that are provided at the project homepage: http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. 

Currently, it is only supported on a Windows operating system.

A preliminary version of an ITD platform for TES studies, released by the name ITD TES System, was developed by Hieu T. Nguyen, Swathi Battula, Rohit Reddy Takkala, and Leigh Tesfatsion; see the following Refs. [1-2]:

The ITD TES Platform does not build on the code/data developed for the ITD TES System in Refs. [1-2]. 

The folder 'TDInterconnection' contains linkage files necessary for simulating the transmission and distribution components of the ITD TES Platform in a coordinated manner.

The released versions of the code can be found at https://github.com/ITDProject/ITDTESPlatform/releases.
